  description: Thesis project - Bus routing for static and dynamic emergency evacuations.
               Combinatorial optimization problem, which considers the planning of
               evacuation routes using public transport in an emergency situation,
               solved with an Evolutionary Algorithm.
               Studies carried out with complete annual tuition fee scholarship.
