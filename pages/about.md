# **About Me**

Hi! I am **{{ site.author.name }}**<br>
I am a professional with abilities to understand, divide and solve complex analytic problems. I have experience in teaching and in research, so I am used to working under high levels of demand and with teams, and I've been also in charge of students. I have good abilities to narrate and expose in front of audiences. I love to be constantly learning new things, and I always look for efficient and innovative ways of doing things. In addition, I consider myself meticulous, organized and responsible. I like traveling and getting to know other cultures. I enjoy studying new languages, I'm a native Spanish speaker and I speak fluent English.

My main interests are Artificial Intelligence, Combinatorial Optimization, Evolutionary Algorithms, Data Science and Machine Learning.
